<h1>21.What are promises and why do we need them?</h1>
    <p>promises is js object that links productive code and consuming code.</p>
    <p>Promise is used to handle asynchronous operations in js .They are easy to manage when dealing with multiple
        asynchronous operation where callbacks can create callback hell leading to unmanged code . </p>
    <h2>There are three states:-</h2>
    pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.<br>
    fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.<br>
    rejected: meaning that the operation failed.<br>

    <h2>Benefits of Promises</h2>

    1. Improves Code Readability<br>
    2. Better handling of asynchronous operations<br>
    3. Better flow of control definition in asynchronous logic<br>
    4. Better error handles.<br>
<pre>
    const promise = new Promise(
  (resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("I'm a Promise!");
    }, 5000);
  },
  (reject) => {}
);

promise.then((value) => console.log(value));

</pre>
    <h1>22.What is the purpose of async/await keywords?</h1>
    <p>Async function is function which is decleared with async keyword . Async function will always returne value . It
        is make sure that promises is returned and if it is not returned then js automaticall wraps it in promises which
        is resolved with its value.</p>

    <p>Await function is used to wait for the promises.</p>

    <h1>23.What is hoisting?</h1>
    <p>Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope
        before code execution. Remember that JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initialisation. </p>
<br>
        <h1>24.what is DOM ?</h1>
        <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content
            of a document on the web. </p>
        <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that
            programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and
            objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.</p>
            <br>

    


    <h1>25.Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN</h1>
    <p> in undefined case where no value has been explicitly assigned to the variable, JavaScript calls it undefined.
    </p>
    <p>Null:- it is one of the js primitive's value and is treated like false in boolen operation. null is an empty
        value and it must be assigned.we use null when we want empty value. </p>
    <p>Not Defined :-A not defined is a variable that is not declared at a given point of time with declaration keyword
        like var, let, or const.</p>

    <h1>26.How many operators do we have in JS ?</h1>
    1. Arithmetic Operators<br>
    2. Comparison Operators<br>
    3. Logical Operators<br>
    4. Assignment Operators<br>
    5. Conditional Operators<br>
    6. Ternary Operator<br>

    <h1>27.What are pure functions?</h1>
    <p>Pure Function is a function (a block of code ) that always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed. It does not depend on any state, or data change during a programâ€™s execution rather it only depends on its input arguments.</p>
<br>
<h1>28.What is callback hell?</h1>
<p>Callback hell is a phenomenon that afflicts a JavaScript developer when he tries to execute multiple asynchronous
    operations one after the other. By nesting callbacks in such a way, we easily end up with error-prone, hard to
    read, and hard to maintain code</p>
<br>
    <h1>29.what is promises chain?</h1>
    <p>The process of executing a sequence of asynchronous operations one after another with the help of promises is known as promise chain. </p>
<br>
<h1>30.what is arror function</h1>
<p>Arrow function is also called fattey function.Arrow function is one of the features introduced in the ES6 version of JavaScript. It allows you to create functions in a cleaner way compared to regular functions. </p>
<br>
<h1>31.Give an example of async/await?</h1>
<pre>
    async function f() {

        let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
          setTimeout(() => resolve("done!"), 1000)
        });
      
        let result = await promise; // wait until the promise resolves (*)
      
        alert(result); // "done!"
      }
      
      f();
</pre>
