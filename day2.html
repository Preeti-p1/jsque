    <h1>6.What are closures?</h1>
    <p>closures is combination of functions. Take a functon and in that function take another function inside.With the
        help of inner function scope execute the outer function scope.
    </p>
    <p>In the other word, the closures gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function</p>
    <br>
    <h1>7.Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods.</h1>
    <p>call(): The call() method invokes a function with a given this value and arguments provided one by one</p><br>
    <p> apply:Invokes the function with a given this value and allows you to pass in arguments as an array</p><br>
    <p>bind: returns a new function, allowing you to pass any number of arguments</p>
    <br>
    <h1>8.Explain prototypes </h1>
    <p>prototype is a blue print of an object that is associated with every function and object by default in js</p>
    <br>
    <h1>9.What is prototype chain?</h1>
    <p>When a property or method is called on an object, if the object doesn’t contain it, the JavaScript engine will
        then look to the object’s prototype to resolve the property or method. You may have seen the term prototype
        chain before.</p>
    <h1>10.What is callback?</h1>
    <p>callback Function is a function passed into another function as an argument .This function is invoked inside the
        outer function to complete the actio</p>
    <br>
    <h1>11.What is the use of setTimeout</h1>
    <P>Syntax: setTimeout(function, time);</P>
    <p>setTimeout is used to execute the code only oncee after the interval time.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>12.What is an event loop and call stack</h1>
    <p>Execution Stack is also known "calling stack" is a stack with a LIFE (last in , fast out)structure which is used
        to store the execution context created during the code execution.</p>
    <P>The event loop is a constantly running process that monitors both the callback queue and the call stack.<br>
        If the call stack is not empty, the event loop waits until it is empty and places the next function from the
        callback queue to the call stack. If the callback queue is empty, nothing will happen
