    <h1>33.What is a Temporal Dead Zone?</h1>
    <p>The Temporal Dead Zone is a behavior in JavaScript that occurs when declaring a variable
        with the let and const keywords, but not with var. In ECMAScript 6, accessing a let or const
        variable before its declaration (within its scope) causes a ReferenceError. The time span when
        that happens, between the creation of a variableâ€™s binding and its declaration, is called the
        temporal dead zone.</p>

        <h1>34.What is the for-in loop in JavaScript? Give its syntax
        </h1>
        <p>The for-in loop is a special type of a loop that iterates over the properties of an object, or the
            elements of an array. for - in loop : returns you the indexes of the arrayThe generic syntax of
            the for-in loop is:
        </p><pre>
            for(variable in object) {
             // Code to be executed
            }</pre>
            <h1>35.Explain Local Scope, Block Scope, Functional Scope and Scope Chain in
                javascript</h1>
               <p> The scope will let us know at a given part of code, what are the variables and functions that we
                can or cannot access.
                There are three types of scopes in JS:
                1.Global Scope
                2.Local or Function Scope
                3.Block Scope
        <p>Global scope:A variable declared at the top of a program or outside of a function is considered a global scope variable.</p>
        <p>Local scope:A variable can also have a local scope, i.e it can only be accessed within a function.
        </p>
        <p>Block scope is related to the variables declared using let and const. Variables declared with var
            do not have block scope.<br>
            Block scope tells us that any variable declared inside a block { }, can be accessed only inside
            that block and cannot be accessed outside of it.</p>
            <p>scope chain:JavaScript engine also uses Scope to find variables.
            </p>
            <h1>36.What is difference between null and undefined and where to use what?</h1>
            
                In JavaScript, undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a
value, such as:<br><pre>
var testVar; alert(testVar); //shows undefined
alert(typeof testVar); //shows undefined</pre>
<p>
null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value:</p><pre>
var testVar = null; alert(testVar); //shows null
alert(typeof testVar); //shows object

            </pre>
            <h1>37.what is symbol.</h1>
            <p>Symbols are new primitive type introduced in ES6. Symbols are completely unique identifiers. Just like their primitive counterparts (Number, String, Boolean), they can be created using the factory function Symbol() which returns a Symbol. Every time you call the factory function, a new and unique symbol is created.</p>
            <h1>38.Write code  to explain map and filter in array</h1>
            <p>Map
                The map() method is used for creating a new array from an existing one, applying a function to each one of the elements of the first array.
                </p>
                Syntax
                <pre>
                var new_array = arr.map(function callback(element, index, array) {
                    // Return value for new_array
                }[, thisArg])</pre>
                <p>example</p>
                <pre>const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
                    const doubled = numbers.map(item => item * 2);
                    console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6, 8]</pre>
                    <p><b>Filter</b>
                        The filter() method takes each element in an array and it applies a conditional statement against it. If this conditional returns true, the element gets pushed to the output array. If the condition returns false, the element does not get pushed to the output array.
                        </p>
                       <p> Syntax</p><pre>
                        var new_array = arr.filter(function callback(element, index, array) {
                            // Return true or false
                        }[, thisArg])</pre>
                        <p>example </p>
                        <pre>const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
                            const evens = numbers.filter(item => item % 2 === 0);
                            console.log(evens); // [2, 4]</pre>
<h1>39.explain pass by value and pass by reference</h1>
<p>"Passing by value" means that you pass the actual value of the variable into the function. So, in your example, it would pass the value 9. "Passing by reference" means that you pass the variable itself into the function (not just the value). So, in your example, it would pass an integer object with the value of 9.
</p>
<h1>40.what is self invoking function in javascript</h1>
<p>A self-invoking expression is invoked (started) automatically, without being called. Function expressions will execute automatically if the expression is followed by (). You cannot self-invoke a function declaration.</p>
